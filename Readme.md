# Cat and Dog Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. It leverages the TensorFlow/Keras framework in Python for deep learning tasks.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build and train a CNN model that can accurately classify images as containing either a cat or a dog.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Download and organize the dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
   - Ensure proper labeling and preprocessing of images.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Design a CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers.
   - Use the softmax activation function for the output layer for binary classification.

3. **Training:**
   - Feed the training data into the model and validate it using the validation set.
   - Adjust hyperparameters like batch size and epochs based on validation performance.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on the test set to measure its accuracy and performance metrics.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize training/validation accuracy and loss curves.
   - Display sample predictions and model interpretations.
